## 2. Data Generation

### 2.1 Where Company Data Comes From

**Source files:**
- `src/data/synthetic_companies.py` — 4 handcrafted test companies
- `src/data/real_companies.py` — 12 companies inspired by real Indian corporates

Each company is a Python dict containing **canonical model dataclass objects**:

```
company_data = {
    "borrower":      Borrower,              # Company identity, sector, PAN, CIN
    "group":         GroupEntity,            # Parent/subsidiary structure
    "directors":     [DirectorPromoter],     # Board members, DIN, shareholding
    "financials":    {period: FinancialStatement},  # FY2022, FY2023, FY2024
    "provisional":   FinancialStatement,     # FY2025 projected (optional)
    "facility":      FacilityRequest,        # What the company is asking for
    "exposures":     [ExistingExposure],     # Current bank limits & utilization
    "collateral":    [Collateral],           # Security offered
    "market_signals": [MarketSignal],        # News, legal, regulatory events
    "conduct":       [ConductRecord],        # ETB only: monthly account behavior
    "covenants":     [CovenantRecord],       # ETB only: covenant compliance
}
```

### 2.3 How POC Documents (PDFs/XLSX/CSV) Are Generated

**Script:** `scripts/generate_poc_documents.py` (~1800 lines)

This script takes the company data and generates **realistic banking documents** for each company. Output goes to `storage/documents/{entity_id}/{category}/`.

**Document Categories & What Gets Generated:**

| Category | Documents | Format | Key Content |
|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **KYC** | PAN card, Certificate of Incorporation, Board Resolution, GST Registration | PDF, TXT | Company identity, registration details |
| **Financials** | Annual Report (3yr), Audited Financial Statements, Provisional FY2025, Debt Schedule, ITR Filing Status | PDF, XLSX | P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow — all from `FinancialStatement.line_items` |
| **Bureau** | Bureau Auto-Fetch, Commercial Bureau Report, CRILC Auto-Fetch, CRILC Report | JSON | Credit score, DPD, SMA status, facility list |
| **Legal** | EPFO Auto-Fetch, EPFO Compliance | JSON | Employee count, compliance status |
| **Collateral** | Valuation Report | PDF | Property/asset valuation, FSV, market value |
| **Ratings** | Credit Rating JSON, Rating Report PDF, Rating Auto-Fetch | JSON, PDF | Agency, instrument, rating, outlook |
| **GST** | GSTIN Auto-Fetch, GSTIN Profile, GST Registration Certificate, GST Turnover, GST Turnover Auto-Fetch | JSON, PDF | GSTIN, turnover by FY, filing regularity |
| **MCA** | Charges Register, Company Master, Director Details, MCA Charges Auto-Fetch, MCA Directors Auto-Fetch, MCA Master Auto-Fetch, MCA Master Data | JSON | ROC data, charges, directors, disqualification status |
| **Banking** | Bank Statement FY2025 | PDF | Monthly transactions (ETB companies) |
| **Misc** | Market Auto-Fetch, Market Intelligence | JSON | News sentiment, reputation risk |

**Per-company document count:** ~13 base + extras for listed (exchange filing, governance report) + extras for ETB (4 CSV conduct files).

### 2.4 How a Specific JSON Document Is Created — Example

**Example: `commercial_bureau_report.json` for BMFG001**

```
Source function: mock_bureau_commercial_report(pan="AABCB1234F")
File: src/data/mock_external_apis.py

Returns:
{
  "source": "bureau_commercial",
  "record_type": "COMMERCIAL_BUREAU_REPORT",
  "entity_key": "AABCB1234F",         ← from borrower.pan
  "as_of_date": "2026-03-13",
  "payload_version": "2.0",
  "source_status": "valid",
  "payload": {
    "entity_name": "Bharat Manufacturing Ltd",
    "credit_score": 782,                ← int, hardcoded per company
    "score_band": "A",
    "total_exposure_cr": 685.0,
    "total_lenders": 4,
    "dpd_status": "Standard",
    "max_dpd_last_12m": 0,
    "worst_status_12m": "Standard",
    "suit_filed_amount_cr": 0.0,
    "wilful_defaulter": false,
    "enquiries_last_6m": 2,
    "facilities": [                     ← synthetic lender exposure breakdown
      {"lender": "SBI", "type": "CC", "limit_cr": 150.0, "outstanding_cr": 128.0, "dpd": 0},
      {"lender": "HDFC", "type": "TL", "limit_cr": 280.0, "outstanding_cr": 245.0, "dpd": 0},
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

**Pattern followed by ALL mock APIs:** Standardized envelope `{source, record_type, entity_key, as_of_date, payload_version, source_status, payload}`. The `payload` contains data-source-specific fields. Different companies return different severity levels (BMFG001 = clean, PINF001 = stressed) to test validation edge cases.

### 2.5 How Financial Data Flows Into Documents

```
FinancialStatement.line_items = {
    "revenue_operating": 1850.0,    ← ₹ Crores
    "ebitda": 322.50,
    "pat": 141.47,
    "total_assets": 1950.0,
    "total_debt": 705.0,
    ...35 fields total
}
     │
     ▼
gen_annual_report(eid)              ← renders P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow tables
gen_audited_financials(eid)         ← renders auditor's report + detailed statements
gen_provisional_financials_excel()  ← renders FY2025 projected numbers in XLSX
```

The document generators **read the same canonical model** and format it into realistic-looking documents with proper Indian financial statement formatting (₹ Crores, lakhs, GAAP terminology).

## 3. Document Extraction

### 3.1 How Extraction Works

**File:** `src/services/document_extractor.py` (~300 lines)

When the user clicks **"Run Extraction"** on the Document Extraction page, the system scans `storage/documents/{entity_id}/` and parses each file:

| File Type | Extraction Method | Library |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| PDF | `extract_pdf()` → text per page + table extraction | pdfplumber |
| XLSX | `extract_excel()` → all sheets as row arrays | openpyxl |
| JSON | Direct Python `json.load()` | stdlib |
| CSV | `csv.DictReader()` | stdlib |
| TXT | Direct file read | stdlib |

### 3.2 Financial Extraction Logic

`extract_financials_from_pdf()` uses a **metric_map** dict to find financial values:

```python
metric_map = {
    "Revenue from Operations": "revenue",
    "EBITDA": "ebitda",
    "Profit After Tax": "pat",
    "Profit Before Tax": "pbt",
    "Total Assets": "total_assets",
    "Total Equity": "total_equity",
    "Total Debt": "total_debt",
    "Depreciation": "depreciation",
    "Finance Cost": "finance_cost",
    "Total Income": "total_income",
}
```

**Strategy:** First tries regex on extracted text (handles "Revenue from Operations    1,850.00" patterns). Falls back to table cell scanning via `_extract_from_table()`.

### 3.3 What the Extraction Page Shows (Screenshot 1)

The extraction page displays:
- **Audited** — Revenue, EBITDA, PBT, PAT, total assets, total equity, total debt, finance cost, depreciation, total income — extracted from the 3 years of audited financial PDFs
- **Annual Report** — Same fields from the annual report PDF (may have slightly different formatting)
- **Provisional Financials** — FY2025 projected vs FY2024 audited comparison
- **Credit Rating** — Agency, rating, outlook from rating JSON/PDF
- **Exchange Filing** — Nine-month revenue, total income, EBITDA, PBT, PAT from quarterly filings
- **GST Data** — GSTIN, total turnover from GST documents

### 3.4 Cross-Validation After Extraction

The validation engine compares extracted values across sources:
- **Audited Revenue** vs **Exchange Filing Revenue** — mismatch > 5% triggers exception
- **Audited Revenue** vs **GST Turnover** — mismatch > 10% triggers exception
- **Audited Debt** vs **Bureau Total Exposure** — mismatch > 20% triggers exception
- **Provisional** vs **Audited** — directional checks for material changes

## 4. Engine Layer

All engines are **100% deterministic** — no ML, no randomness, same input always produces same output.

### 4.1 Ratio Engine

**File:** `src/engines/ratio_engine.py` (~380 lines)

Computes **27 financial ratios** per period from `FinancialStatement.line_items`:

| Category | Ratios | Formula Highlights |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Liquidity** | Current Ratio | Current Assets / Current Liabilities |
| **Leverage** | Debt/Equity, Debt/EBITDA, Debt/Tangible NW, Net Debt/EBITDA, TOL/TNW | Standard leverage formulas |
| **Coverage** | ICR, DSCR, Fixed Charge Coverage | EBITDA/Interest, (EBITDA×0.8)/(Interest+Principal), EBITDA/(Interest+Lease) |
| **Profitability** | NPM, EBITDA Margin, Cash Profit Margin, ROE, ROA, ROCE | Standard margin/return formulas |
| **Efficiency** | Asset Turnover, Debtor Days, Inventory Days, Payable Days, Working Capital Cycle | Days = (Item/Revenue)×365 |
| **Cash Flow** | OCF/Debt, FCFF, Capex/Depreciation | Cash flow adequacy measures |
| **Distress** | Altman Z-Score, Tangible Net Worth, Contingent Liability Ratio | Z = 1.2×A + 1.4×B + 3.3×C + 0.6×D + 1.0×E |

**Entry point:** `compute_all_ratios(financial_statement)` → `list[RatioResult]`

### 4.2 Benchmark Engine

**File:** `src/engines/benchmark_engine.py` (~200 lines)

Compares borrower ratios against **sector peer benchmarks** (P25, median, P75):

```
4 sectors × 15 metrics each:
  Manufacturing, Infrastructure, Pharma, Logistics

Classification:
  BETTER  → ratio in favorable zone (above P75 for "higher is better" / below P25 for "higher is worse")
  WITHIN  → between P25 and P75
  WORSE   → unfavorable zone
```

### 4.3 Validation Engine

**File:** `src/engines/validation_engine.py` (~650 lines)

Runs **30+ validation rules** across 7 categories:

| Category | # Rules | What It Checks |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Structural | 3 | Balance sheet balances, PAT consistency, EBITDA consistency |
| Cross-Source | 4 | Revenue vs Exchange Filing (±5%), Revenue vs GST (±10%), Debt vs Bureau (±20%), Bureau DPD/SMA/NPA/Wilful |
| Analytical | 3 | Receivable spike (>30% vs <15% revenue growth), Negative OCF with revenue growth, 3yr consecutive margin decline |
| Temporal | 1 | Stale financials (>365 days old) |
| Policy | 1 | Mandatory documents for NTB (KYC, board resolution, 3yr audited, collateral) |
| Conduct (ETB) | 2 | Cheque returns, DPD, utilization, covenant breaches |
| Document-Extraction | 1 | Cross-checks extracted revenue across audited/provisional/exchange/GST docs |

**Output:** `list[ValidationException]` with severity: CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW

### 4.4 Policy Engine

**File:** `src/engines/policy_engine.py` (~450 lines)

Three-tier **DMN-style** credit decision framework:

**Tier 1 — Hard Rules (Pass/Fail Gates):**
| Rule | Condition | Result |
|------|-----------|--------|
| HR_WILFUL_DEFAULTER | Bureau wilful_defaulter = true | FAIL → auto-decline |
| HR_COMPANY_ACTIVE | MCA status != "Active" | FAIL |
| HR_NO_CRITICAL_EXCEPTIONS | Any critical validation exception | FAIL |
| HR_KYC_COMPLETE | Missing mandatory KYC docs (NTB) | FAIL |
| HR_BUREAU_STATUS | SMA-2 or worse | FAIL |
| HR_MIN_VINTAGE | Company < 3 years old (NTB) | FAIL |
| HR_FRAUD_REGISTRY | On fraud registry | FAIL |
| HR_RBI_DEFAULTER | RBI defaulter list | FAIL |
| HR_SUIT_FILED | Suits > 25% of exposure | FAIL |

**Tier 2 — Risk Scoring (Composite 0-100):**

| Component | Weight | Base Score | Key Adjustments |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| Financial | 40% | 65 | ±leverage, ±coverage, ±profitability, ±liquidity, ±cash flow, ±Altman Z, ±benchmarks |
| Conduct | 25% | 75 (ETB) / 70 (NTB) | Penalties: cheque returns, DPD, high utilization, covenant breaches |
| Governance | 20% | 65 | ±credit rating (AAA +15 to B -15), ±outlook, ±board independence, ±promoter concentration |
| Market | 15% | 70 | ±positive/negative market signals by severity |

**Composite Score → Risk Grade:**
| Grade | Score Range | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| A | ≥ 80 | Low Risk |
| B | ≥ 65 | Moderate Risk |
| C | ≥ 50 | Medium Risk |
| D | ≥ 35 | High Risk |
| E | < 35 | Very High Risk |

**Tier 3 — Recommendation:**
| Condition | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Any Tier-1 failure | DECLINE |
| Score ≥ 65, no high exceptions | APPROVE |
| Score 50-64 | APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS |
| Score 35-49 | REFER (to higher authority) |
| Score < 35 or multiple high exceptions | DECLINE |

### 4.5 Fraud Detection Engine

**File:** `src/engines/fraud_detection_engine.py` (~350 lines)

7-signal forensic analysis — **no ML models, all formula-based:**

| Signal | Weight | Method | Threshold |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Beneish M-Score** | 25% | 8-variable manipulation model (DSRI, GMI, AQI, SGI, DEPI, SGAI, LVGI, TATA) | M > -1.78 = likely manipulator |
| **Benford's Law** | 10% | Chi-squared test on leading digits of financial line items | χ² > 21.67 = significant deviation |
| **Revenue Consistency** | 20% | Cross-source divergence (audited vs provisional vs exchange filing vs GST) | > 10% spread = flag |
| **Altman Z-Score** | 10% | Financial distress indicator (overlap with fraud) | Z < 1.81 = distress zone |
| **Governance Red Flags** | 15% | Multiple directorships, disqualified directors, concentrated shareholding | Weighted flags |
| **Document Anomaly** | 10% | Metadata forensic checks on submitted documents | Pattern-based rules |
| **Circular Transactions** | 10% | Evergreening signals, related-party circular flows | Ratio-based thresholds |

**Output:** FraudReport with composite_score (0-100), risk_grade: LOW (<25), MEDIUM (<45), HIGH (<65), CRITICAL (≥65)

## 5. LLM & ML Usage

### 5.1 Summary: What Uses AI vs What Doesn't

| Component | AI? | Technology |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| Financial Advisor Chat | **YES — LLM** | Ollama Qwen2.5 32B |
| CAM Narrative (optional) | **YES — LLM** (with template fallback) | Ollama Qwen2.5 32B |
| Ratio Engine | No | Deterministic formulas |
| Benchmark Engine | No | Rule-based comparison |
| Validation Engine | No | Rule-based checks |
| Policy Engine | No | DMN-style decision rules |
| Fraud Detection | No | Statistical formulas (Beneish, Benford, Altman) |
| ETB Analytics | No | Score-based behavioral analysis |
| Document Extraction | No | Regex + table parsing (pdfplumber) |
| CAM Fact Builder | No | Data assembly |
| CAM Renderer | No | Template-based rendering |
| Core Banking Engine | No | Score-based relationship analysis |
| Social Media Engine | No | Mock-data digital intelligence |
| PEP Screening | No | Database matching (deterministic) |
| Document Downloader | No | Live NSE API + pre-verified financial data |
| CRILC Report Generator | No | Deterministic PDF generation (reportlab) |

### 5.2 LLM Provider Framework

**File:** `src/core/llm_provider.py` (~200 lines)

Pluggable provider architecture — swap LLMs via `config/llm_providers.yaml` without code changes:

| Provider | Class | Transport | Status |
|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Ollama (Local)** | `OllamaProvider` | POST `http://localhost:11434/api/generate` | **Active — qwen2.5:32b** |
| OpenAI | `OpenAIProvider` | OpenAI Python SDK | Available (needs API key) |
| Anthropic | `AnthropicProvider` | Anthropic Python SDK | Available (needs API key) |
| Azure OpenAI | `AzureOpenAIProvider` | Azure SDK | Available (needs endpoint+key) |
| Mock | `MockLLMProvider` | Returns template text | Fallback |

**Configuration (`config/llm_providers.yaml`):**
```yaml
active_provider: "ollama"
narrative:
  mode: "llm"                    # "template" for no LLM, "llm" for active provider
  temperature: 0.15
  max_tokens: 16000
  max_tokens_per_section: 2500
providers:
  ollama:
    model: "qwen2.5:32b"
    base_url: "http://localhost:11434"
    temperature: 0.15
    max_tokens: 16000
```

### 5.3 Financial Advisor Chat (LLM)

**File:** `src/services/analyst_chat.py` (~430 lines)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Model** | qwen2.5:32b via Ollama `/api/generate` |
| **Temperature** | 0.3 (low creativity, factual) |
| **Max tokens** | 500 per response |
| **Context** | Company fact-pack (financial_summary, ratios, strengths, risks, collateral, hierarchy, etc.) |
| **System prompt** | "Expert credit analyst and financial advisor" persona |
| **Session management** | In-memory per entity_id, max 20 messages |
| **Fallback** | If Ollama unavailable → keyword-based rule extraction |

**How context is built:**
```
build_context(case_data, extraction, etb_analysis) →
  - Financial Performance (revenue, EBITDA, PAT from fact_pack)
  - Key Financial Ratios (D/E, ICR, current ratio, etc.)
  - Credit Strengths (from fact_pack.credit_strengths)
  - Key Risks (from fact_pack.key_risks)
  - Collateral Coverage
  - Hierarchy Info
  - Cash Flow & Repayment
  - Conditions & Covenants
  - Validation Exceptions
  Truncated to MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS=6000
```

### 5.4 CAM Narrative Generation (Optional LLM)

When `narrative.mode: "llm"` in config, the `NarrativeAgent` in `src/agents/narrative_agent.py`:

1. Builds fact-pack JSON (deterministic)
2. Sends entire fact-pack as prompt to LLM: *"Generate a complete Credit Approval Memorandum from this fact-pack"*
3. System prompt enforces: use only facts from JSON, no hallucination, formal banking language
4. **Fallback:** If LLM returns < 100 chars or error → falls back to template renderer automatically

**In practice:** The template renderer (`cam_renderer.py`) produces higher quality, more consistent output than LLM. LLM mode is primarily for demonstration purposes.

### 5.5 What Is NOT ML

Some components use **statistical formulas** that look like ML but aren't:

| Component | Technique | Why It's Not ML |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Beneish M-Score** | 8-variable linear formula | Fixed coefficients discovered by research (1999), no training |
| **Benford's Law** | Chi-squared test on digit distribution | Pure statistics, no model |
| **Altman Z-Score** | 5-factor linear discriminant | Fixed formula (1968), no model fitting |
| **Risk Scoring** | Weighted component scoring | Manually defined weights and thresholds |

---

## 6. Agent Pipeline

**Files:** `src/agents/pipeline.py` (orchestrator) and one module per agent in `src/agents/`

`SuperAgent.execute_pipeline(company_data)` runs 7 sub-agents. Each agent declares
`requires` (agents that must succeed first — their results, or their changes to
`company_data`, are needed) and `waits_for` (agents whose result it uses if present).
With `pipeline.parallel_agents: true` (default, `config/settings.yaml`) an agent starts
as soon as those have finished, so independent agents run side by side; with `false` they
run one at a time in list order. The pipeline log is kept in list order either way.

```
data_ingestion ─┬─ financial_analysis ── benchmark ─┐
                └─ validation ──────────────────────┴─ policy ─┐
pep_screening ─────────────────────────────────────────────────┴─ narrative
```

| # | Agent | Critical | requires / waits_for | Does |
|---|-------|----------|----------------------|------|
| 1 | DataIngestionAgent | yes | — | DMS fetch, document extraction (cached per file), uploaded-financials overrides on `company_data`, authenticity fingerprints, ETB analytics, cached verified public records (Probe42) |
| 2 | PEPScreeningAgent | no | — | Directors against PEP/sanctions lists |
| 3 | FinancialAnalysisAgent | yes | requires ingestion | `ratio_engine` over all periods (ingestion may first replace financials from uploads) |
| 4 | ValidationAgent | yes | requires ingestion | Structural, cross-source and policy validations → exceptions |
| 5 | BenchmarkAgent | yes | requires financial analysis | Sector peer percentiles |
| 6 | PolicyAgent | yes | requires 3, 4, 5 | Tier 1 hard rules, tier 2 risk score, tier 3 recommendation |
| 7 | NarrativeAgent | yes | requires 3–6; waits_for PEP | Fact pack (reusing the PEP result) and CAM text: templates, or the LLM via `cam_llm_renderer` with prompts from `cam_sections.py` |

**Critical flag:** if a critical agent fails, the pipeline stops and the run is recorded as
failed (`GET /api/cases/{id}/runs`). PEP screening is the only non-critical agent; if it
fails, the narrative screens the directors itself.

**Narrative execution path** depends on the active LLM provider: on hosted providers up to
`narrative.max_parallel_sections` sections are written at once; Ollama writes one at a time
with one context size for the run. LLM-written sections are checkpointed as they finish, so a
failed run resumes. See the README section *Pipeline execution & performance*.

## 9. FAQ — Common Questions

### Q: "How is this JSON created?"

Every JSON in the document store follows ONE pattern:

1. **Source data** comes from `synthetic_companies.py` or `real_companies.py` (canonical Python dataclass objects)
2. **Mock APIs** (`mock_external_apis.py`) simulate external data sources (bureau, MCA, GST, etc.) and return standardized JSON envelopes
3. **Document generators** (`generate_poc_documents.py`) take source data and create realistic PDFs/XLSX
4. **The fact-pack JSON** is assembled by `cam_fact_builder.py` which calls ALL engines and packs 24 sections

### Q: "Where does the financial data in the extraction page come from?"

The extraction page shows data **parsed backwards from generated documents**:
- Audited financials → extracted from PDF using pdfplumber + regex
- Annual report → extracted from PDF
- Provisional → extracted from XLSX using openpyxl
- Credit rating → extracted from rating JSON/PDF
- Exchange filing → extracted from filing PDF
- GST → extracted from GST JSON/PDF

This is intentional — it simulates the real-world flow where a bank receives physical/digital documents and needs to extract structured data.

### Q: "What ML models are used?"

**No traditional ML models are used.** The platform is primarily rule-based/deterministic. LLM (Large Language Model) is used only for:
1. **Financial Advisor Chat** — Ollama Qwen2.5 32B
2. **Optional CAM narrative generation** — same LLM, with template fallback

Statistical formulas like Beneish M-Score, Benford's Law, and Altman Z-Score are NOT ML — they are fixed mathematical formulas from academic research.

### Q: "Can I switch to a different LLM?"

Yes. Edit `config/llm_providers.yaml`:
- Set `active_provider: "openai"` and provide `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var for GPT-4
- Set `active_provider: "anthropic"` and provide `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude
- Set `active_provider: "mock"` for fully deterministic (no LLM calls at all)
- Current active: `qwen2.5:32b` (32B parameter model — significantly better narration quality than 8B)

### Q: "What happens if Ollama is down?"

- **Financial Advisor Chat** → Falls back to keyword-based rule extraction (searches fact-pack context for relevant data)
- **CAM Narrative** → Falls back to template renderer (`cam_renderer.py`) — produces identical output every time
- **All engines** → Unaffected, they never use LLM (including social_media_engine and core_banking_engine)

### Q: "How are risk scores calculated?"

Composite = 40% Financial + 25% Conduct + 20% Governance + 15% Market.
Each component starts at a base score (65-75) and gets adjustments based on ratio quality, benchmark position, conduct history, credit rating, board composition, and market signals. See Section 4.4 for full details.

### Q: "How does the fraud detection work without ML?"

It uses 7 research-backed forensic techniques:
- **Beneish M-Score** (1999) — 8-variable formula that identifies earnings manipulation
- **Benford's Law** — statistical test on digit distribution (natural data follows a specific pattern; fabricated data doesn't)
- **Altman Z-Score** (1968) — 5-factor distress predictor
- Cross-source revenue consistency checks
- Governance red flag scoring
- All are **deterministic formulas** — no model training, no neural networks.
